These are the codes I developed while completing the "freeCodeCamp.org" course on YouTube. Each notebook represents a project, and the three preliminary projects are as follows:
1.Getting Started with Word Embeddings
2.Performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews and text classification using an RNN
3.After reading a "Shakespear" snippet, The model generates similar styled text using an RNN
